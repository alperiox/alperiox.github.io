# About

Hello! I'm Alper,

I recently finished my undergraduate Mathematics studies as an honorary student and I love working on deep learning. I'm more interested in stable diffusion and computer vision whereas I'm kinda diving deep in LLMs as of the moment, while trying to build something I deem valuable. I also like to work on mathematical concepts, especially on applied mathematics in higher studies. I want to try and work on things I'm interested in, mainly:

- Generative applications based on stable diffusion
- LLMs and their inner workings (Andrej Karpathy is just too good as an instructor)
- Inner workings of stable diffusion (I see so many interesting papers lately!)
- Deep learning productionalization, from data collection to modeling at scale.
- Thanks to one of my instructors, I got interested in applying deep learning to specifically differential equation systems. Hopefully will be able to do it on my own :D

I'm a freelancer and am open to opportunities for full-time at the moment.

**I'm an empirical and imaginative person. I learned mathematics by visualizing my imagination, and I try to implement the same strategy as long as it works :D**
